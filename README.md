# Scadrial

A secure process for standing up and managing your own environment as a virtual home-lab using Mistborn.

# What is Scadrial

While the term Mistborn is inspired by a series of epic fantasy novels written by American author Brandon Sanderson, Scadrial is inspired by the name of the planet on which the Mistborn trilogy is set. Rather than living on a cloud-based virtual server, Scadrial is a local virtual server where Mistborn live.

Scadrial started as a passion project for buildomg a secure home lab environment that includes file hosting, synchronization, media sharing and office suite. The Mistborn project already handles those needs and more, with the creation of a virtual cloud services so nicely. We wanted a quick, automated, and reproducible process for standing up Mistborn in our home lab server environment.
